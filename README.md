# Dynamic Graph Embedding for Fault Detection

----------
- Code for the paper "Dynamic Graph Embedding for Fault Detection"
- The demo codes can be found in the directory "Matlab_code". They are developed to do the fault detection on the data of Fault 1. the file "myConstructW.m" is developed to obtain the similarities in Equation (6). In the file, we give the annotations according the Eqautions in the paper. "myfunction_tensorLPP_markov_paper.m" is the main program, which can run directly. "TensorLGE" and "TensorLPP" are the codes designed by Deng cai, which is the second author of the paper "Tensor Subspace Analysis", published in Neural Information Processing Systems 18 (NIPS 2005).
- "File_published_by_matlab_in_PDF.pdf" is the running results and the codes published with MATLAB® R2015b. "Files_and_results_published_by_matlab.zip" contains the html version published with MATLAB® R2015b.
